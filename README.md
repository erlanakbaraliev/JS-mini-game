# **Name: Desert Survival Game**  
This project is a survival-based game where the player navigates a 5x5 desert grid, managing water resources and uncovering hidden parts to win. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, the game challenges players to strategize while exploring and surviving.

## **Features**  
- **5x5 Game Board**: A grid with randomly placed oases and hidden clues.  
- **Player Initialization**: Starts in the center of the board.  
- **Resource Management**: Water supply decreases after each turn and can be replenished at oases.  
- **Clue Discovery**: Hidden clues lead to parts required for victory.  
- **Game Over Conditions**:  
  - Victory: Find all three parts and survive.  
  - Defeat: Run out of water before completing the objectives.  
- **Turn-Based Actions**: Perform up to three actions per turn, such as moving or digging.  
- **Aesthetic Design**: A visually appealing interface.

## **Controls**  
- **Movement**: Click or select adjacent squares to move.  
- **Digging**: Reveal hidden clues and items by digging on the current square.

## **How It Works**  
1. **Rendering**:  
   - The board, oases, and player are dynamically displayed using HTML and CSS.  
2. **Gameplay Mechanics**:  
   - Players lose water after each turn and replenish it by digging at oases.  
3. **Randomization**:  
   - Clues and oases are placed randomly to ensure unique playthroughs.  
4. **Game Logic**:  
   - Players can only collect required parts after finding clues.  
   - Only three of the four oases contain water.
